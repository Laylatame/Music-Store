# Music Store

## Basic Information

Use this repository to build a music store. Clone the code to your local machine and upload your changes as a pull request. 

Feel free to use any gems or libraries that may help you develop the final application (such as authentication styling, testing, admin gems, etc).

The purpose of this code challenge is to see your coding practices and architecture definition. You are not expected to deliver a fully developed, styled and sophisticated application. The main requirement is for the application to be functional and scalable.

## Description

Create a music store where records can be bought. There are two types of users, those wishing to sell records and those who want to buy them.

### Buyer
* Can see all available records
* Can add available records to their cart
* Can proceed to buy records in cart
* Once a record is bought, they should not be available for other users
* Can see a listing of their bought records

### Seller
* Can add new records as available to sell
* Can see a listing of their registered records (sold or available)


## Additional Info

* The application is a blank canvas, feel free to explore or develop additional features, use different technologies or add details to improve the application.
* Commit the logic as you are developing, as you would a regular application. A good commit log helps us follow your thought process.
* Reach out to us if you have any questions, we are always open to help.

Good to have (optional)
* Add validations for models when required
* Add automated testing for certain models, views or controllers
* Use stimulus/turbo to simulate single page app for controller responses.
